=== New and Updated Features

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 1.10:

* Expert info is now filterable (if the dissector has been updated to support
  the new API).
* The Windows installer now uninstalls the previous version of Wireshark
  silently.  You can still run the uninstaller manually beforehand if you wish
  to run it interactively.
* The "Number" column shows related packets and protocol conversation spans
  (Qt only).
* When manipulating packets with editcap using the -C <choplen> and/or
  -s <snaplen> options, it is now possible to also adjust the original frame
  length using the -L option.
* You can now pass the -C <choplen> option to editcap multiple times, which
  allows you to chop bytes from the beginning of a packet as well as at the end
  of a packet in a single step.
